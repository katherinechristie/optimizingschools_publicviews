This information sheet outlines the purpose of the study and provides a description of your involvement and rights as a participant, if you agree to take part.



1. What is the research about?

We want to know what people think about different ways of getting money to small businesses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, local governments have used different approaches to deciding which businesses get help. We want to know what you think about these different programs. 



2. Do I have to take part?

No, you don't. It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. You do not have to take part if you do not want to. 



3. What will my involvement be?

This survey takes about 5 minutes. You will need to read instructions and answer some multiple choice and rank-order questions. There are 3 open-ended questions where you have to briefly write/explain an answer. 



4. How do I withdraw from the study?

You can withdraw from the study at any point until you have completed the survey, without having to give a reason. If any questions make you feel uncomfortable, you can stop answering. We will not analyze any incomplete responses, so if you stop the survey before the end, your responses will not be included in any analyses or reports.  



5. What will my information be used for?

I will use the survey responses for an academic paper. I may also share my findings in research talks, reports, blog posts, etc. 



6. Will my taking part and my data be kept confidential? Will it be anonymised?

Your data will be anonymised – you do not give your name so your responses can not be matched back to you. The data will be posted on a website where other researchers can analyze it to check my results or test their own hypotheses. Before it is posted, Prolific IDs and IP addresses will be deleted. 



8. Who has reviewed this study?

This study has undergone ethics review in accordance with the LSE Research Ethics Policy and Procedure.

(1) Small businesses applied asking the government for help

(2) The government checked to see if a small business was eligible

(3) Among the eligible small businesses, the agency is considering using one of the following three methods to select which 500 small businesses will get a grant.

I have been in many lotteries for housing & for years I was entered into so many different lotteties but could never obtain housing because due to the lotteties I would rank all different numbers in the pool. One time I finally ranked number 12 in a lottery that had 13 apartments available so I felt like I was definitely going to be moving into one of these apartments only to find myself stuck on the same waiting list for the next year & a half. Needless to say, I was very frustrated because I would constantly be putting in the time, effort, & dedication to fill out hundreds of applications only to be randomly ranked in different places due to the lottery & had it been based off of ""first come, first served"" I am confident that I would have been much more likely to obtain housing because I was taking the initiative to actively look for housing everyday.
