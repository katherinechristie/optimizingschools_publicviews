","Because it hopefully assigns a fair point system to the individuals most in need based on hopefully less biased metrics."
45,3,1,2,"Because the people who first submitted the application became interested in their company and know that they will not be able to do it without help.","Because in the point system there was a criterion in which companies run by women receive additional points, which is not fair. It is now popular to try to increase the proportion of women in leader positions, but it was not without reason that this was the case in the past. If women are struggling with discrimination by discriminating against men this is not appropriate.

11,1,2,3,"A point system is more fair because it takes different factors into consideration thus ensuring equitable distribution of the resources.","A lottery is too random, people who are able to get everything in order to apply should be rewarded for their effort instead of it being left to chance."
17,1,3,2,"I think point system will make it more likely that people who need the money the most and will benefit the most will get it. Many people will apply even if they don't absolutely need it.","I think those who apply first may have access to more resources. They found out first and had the capability to apply first, which may show they already have other advantages. Those who hear about it later, have difficulty applying, or do not use English as their first language most likely need the money the most but may not be able to apply as quickly."
34,2,1,3,"Allowing businesses to be ambitious to receive government help is what will motivate them to do so in the first place. Having a lottery in place will provide no motivation to seek any help since they know it's all random.","Lottery is just one hundred percent random so no one would be able to take any initiative to receive any help."
39,2,3,1,"I think it should just be random if everyone isn't getting them. No one should get ahead in the system. Just do it fairly.","First come first serve is dumb. Not everyone has the time."

2,1,2,3,"A points system takes into account the actual situations of the company; someone who needs it more but did not apply first would have a chance to receive the assistance they need.","First-come, first-served requires companies to put in the effort to try hard to receive the aid. The lottery does not."
6,1,2,3,"It sounds like it would provide a more nuanced, thoughtful approach than the other two options. First-come, first-served seems like it could leave out businesses that are preoccupied with their concerns and miss the announcement, and a lottery just seems too random.","A lottery seems like it's just abandoning all attempts to make a rational decision about the disbursement of funds."

8,1,2,3,"Typically small businesses owned by people of color are more likely to undergo a financial crisis. Additionally, I believe that small businesses that have been operating for longer periods of time should receive help because many small businesses serve as pieces of history in communities. This seems to be more fair compared to the others.","The lottery seems the least fair because small businesses that desperately need financial assistance should not receive financial assistance on the basis of chance. Athough I also do not agree with first come first served, this method seems alittle more fair. The idea is that businesses that are expecting a financial crisis are more likely to apply first."
12,1,2,3,"the problem with FCFS is that it favors the fastest responders. But they are not necessarily more needy than slower responders. In fact, slower responders might in fact be more needy (they had to walk, or take a bus to submit their request, rather than call a cab or drive their Lexus).","it is the least fair because it depends simply on randomness--it does not consider real circumstances."

7,1,2,3,"The points system is more effective than first come, first served because it makes it makes it so that people who are in need of a grant more of a priority than the rest of the people applying. If the business owners are able to keep their businesses it keeps them employed  
which in turn stabilizes the economy & keeps America progressive.","I feel like people who are actively looking into
getting a grant to save their business should be more likely to receive the money available first rather than doing a lottery because by giving it to people randomly is not as fair as it would be if the grants were distributed to the people who are taking the initiative to do whatever they can to help themselves better their situation. I have been in many lotteries for housing & for years I was entered into so many different lotteties but could never obtain housing because due to the lotteties I would rank all different numbers in the pool. One time I finally ranked number 12 in a lottery that had 13 apartments available so I felt like I was definitely going to be moving into one of these apartments only to find myself stuck on the same waiting list for the next year & a half. Needless to say, I was very frustrated because I would constantly be putting in the time, effort, & dedication to fill out hundreds of applications only to be randomly ranked in different places due to the lottery & had it been based off of ""first come, first served"" I am confident that I would have been much more likely to obtain housing because I was taking the initiative to actively look for housing everyday. If you are dedicated to what you are trying to do I feel that is admirable & should be taken into consideration when dispersing any available grants."

49,3,2,1,"I think a lottery is most fair because it is randomly selected. A first-come, first-served and points based system have inherent biases to them. Specifically, the points system will prioritize businesses over others on account of characteristics like race, which I feel is unfair, even if the purpose is to help. Furthermore, if all the businesses are eligible in the first place, I feel as though a points based system to track damages and etc are redundant. The first-come, first-served business model is less random than a lottery, because it benefits those who have the privilege of knowing about the services first.","Points system categorizes businesses on account of characteristics such as race that will be inherently biased. Not all minority owned businesses need help, and not all white owned businesses don't need help, so it seems discriminatory to give money to people based on a preconceived notion rather than what they actually need."

40,2,3,1,"It is the most fair by virtue of its complete lack of distinction. No matter the characteristics of a business or business owner, each has an equal chance of being chosen.","I think that first-come first-served is less fair than a lottery, because it still places a preferential treatment upon those who come first, rather than having no preference at all. And I think that it is also less morally fair than a points system, which attempts to place value upon business characteristics."
