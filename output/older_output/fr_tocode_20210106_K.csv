This targeted aid means that businesses that provide unique importance to the local economy like women or people of color-owned businesses receive the aid they need to stay afloat, which ensures small businesses can remain diverse instead of white, male-dominated. A lottery system is fair in its complete randomness, but that means there's more potential for less diverse businesses to receive the aid over more diverse.","First-come first-serve systems can be unfair because they allow those who have the resources and ability to apply quicker than others to benefit first.
